# Modernized MySQL Query Lab

![CI Pipeline](https://github.com/benkaan001/mysql_query_lab/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

## Objective

This repository provides a containerized and tested environment for practicing and exploring SQL queries against various datasets. It serves as a demonstration of modern data engineering and software development practices, including Docker, automated testing, and CI/CD.

This project is a modernized version of an earlier query lab. The original code is preserved in the `legacy/v1.0` branch.

## Tech Stack (Planned)

* Database: MySQL (via Docker)
* Containerization: Docker, Docker Compose
* Data Loading/Scripting: Python 3.x
* Core Python Libraries: Pandas, SQLAlchemy, python-dotenv
* Testing: Pytest
* CI/CD: GitHub Actions
* Code Quality: Black, Flake8/Ruff, SQLFluff (optional)

## Rebuild Journey

This section will document the key steps and rationale behind the modernization process carried out on the `main` branch.

* **Phase 0:** Preserve existing code, initialize `main` branch and README. (Current)
* **Phase 1:** Containerize MySQL environment using Docker Compose.
* **Phase 2:** Implement automated data loading script(s) using Python.
* **Phase 3:** Add integration and unit tests using Pytest.
* **Phase 4:** Refine database schema and add example SQL queries.
* **Phase 5:** Implement CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
* **Phase 6:** Final polish and documentation review.
