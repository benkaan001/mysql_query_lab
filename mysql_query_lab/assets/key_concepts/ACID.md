# ACID in SQL

ACID is a set of properties that guarantee reliable processing of database transactions. It stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.

## Atomicity

Atomicity ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. It means that if any part of a transaction fails, the entire transaction will be rolled back, and the database will be returned to its previous state. This is important to maintain the integrity of the database and prevent data corruption.

## Consistency

Consistency ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another. It means that any constraints or rules defined in the database schema will be enforced during the transaction. For example, if a transaction involves updating a row in a table, the new values must conform to any constraints defined on the table, such as not allowing null values or enforcing a unique key constraint.

## Isolation

Isolation ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other. It means that each transaction must execute as if it is the only transaction in the system, even if multiple transactions are executing at the same time. Isolation can be achieved using locks, which prevent other transactions from accessing data that is being modified by a transaction.

## Durability

Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, it will persist even if the system fails. It means that the changes made by a transaction must be recorded in a permanent storage medium, such as a hard disk or solid-state drive, so that they can be recovered in the event of a failure.

ACID compliance is an essential feature of any database management system, especially in applications that require high levels of data integrity and reliability, such as financial transactions, e-commerce, and healthcare systems.

By following the principles of ACID, developers can ensure that their database transactions are reliable, consistent, and durable, even in the face of failures and concurrent access. This can provide users with a high level of confidence in the data they are interacting with and help to prevent errors and data corruption.
