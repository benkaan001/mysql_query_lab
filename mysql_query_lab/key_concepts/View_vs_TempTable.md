A view and a temporary table are both database objects used to store data, but there are some key differences between them:

1. Definition: A view is a virtual table that does not contain any data, but instead, retrieves data from one or more underlying tables. A temporary table, on the other hand, is a physical table that is created at runtime and stores data that is generated during a particular session.

2. Storage: A view does not store data, but instead, retrieves data from the underlying tables each time the view is queried. A temporary table, on the other hand, stores data in a physical table that exists in the database.

3. Persistence: A view is a persistent object in the database, meaning it exists until it is explicitly dropped. A temporary table, on the other hand, is dropped automatically at the end of the session in which it was created.

4. Usage: Views are commonly used for providing a simplified or customized view of the data to the users. They can also be used to provide an additional level of security by limiting the data that a user can access. Temporary tables, on the other hand, are commonly used for intermediate storage of data during complex queries or calculations.

5. Performance: Views can improve performance by reducing the complexity of queries and by providing a pre-defined set of columns and data that can be retrieved quickly. Temporary tables can also improve performance by allowing intermediate results to be stored and reused during complex queries or calculations.

In summary, views and temporary tables have different purposes and usage scenarios. Views are used to simplify the querying of data, while temporary tables are used to store intermediate results during complex queries or calculations.
