# A Brief Guide to Views and Temporary Tables in SQL

A view and a temporary table are both database objects used to store data, but there are some key differences between them:

1. **Definition**: A view is a virtual table that does not contain any data, but instead, retrieves data from one or more underlying tables. A temporary table, on the other hand, is a physical table that is created at runtime and stores data that is generated during a particular session.

2. **Storage**: A view does not store data, but instead, retrieves data from the underlying tables each time the view is queried. A temporary table, on the other hand, stores data in a physical table that exists in the database.

3. **Persistence**: A view is a persistent object in the database, meaning it exists until it is explicitly dropped. A temporary table, on the other hand, is dropped automatically at the end of the session in which it was created.

4. **Usage**: Views are commonly used for providing a simplified or customized view of the data to the users. They can also be used to provide an additional level of security by limiting the data that a user can access. Temporary tables, on the other hand, are commonly used for intermediate storage of data during complex queries or calculations.

5. **Performance**: Views can improve performance by reducing the complexity of queries and by providing a pre-defined set of columns and data that can be retrieved quickly. Temporary tables can also improve performance by allowing intermediate results to be stored and reused during complex queries or calculations.

## Views

A view is a virtual table that is based on the result of a SELECT statement. It allows users to see a customized version of a table without actually modifying the original data. Views are useful for:

- Simplifying complex queries by predefining commonly used filters, sorts, and aggregations.
- Restricting access to sensitive data by creating a view that only shows a subset of the original data.
- Providing a consistent interface to data by combining multiple tables into a single view.

Creating a view is easy: simply use the CREATE VIEW statement followed by a SELECT statement that defines the view's data. Here's an example:

```SQL
CREATE VIEW customer_orders AS
SELECT customers.name, orders.order_date, orders.total_amount
FROM customers
INNER JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;
```

Once created, the view can be queried like any other table:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM customer_orders;
```

## Temporary Tables

Temporary tables are similar to views in that they are based on a SELECT statement, but they are physical tables that exist only for the duration of a session or transaction. They are useful for:

- Storing intermediate results for complex queries.
- Performing batch updates on large amounts of data.
- Separating large queries into smaller, more manageable steps.

Creating a temporary table is similar to creating a regular table, but with the addition of the keyword "TEMPORARY". Here's an example:

```SQL
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_orders
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date >= '2022-01-01';
```

Once created, the temporary table can be queried, updated, and joined like any other table:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM temp_orders WHERE total_amount > 100;
UPDATE temp_orders SET status = 'shipped' WHERE id = 123;
```

At the end of the session or transaction, the temporary table is automatically dropped, freeing up any resources it was using.

## Conclusion

Views and temporary tables are powerful SQL features that can help simplify complex queries, improve performance, and enhance data security. By understanding how they work and when to use them, you can become a more effective SQL developer and data analyst.
